I've been on a few engineering teams that turned toxic, some over time, and some from the start. While on these teams, I:

<BlogText>
* Felt anxious and stressed, all the time
* I was not good at compartmentalizing, so I allowed the bad work situation to affect my personal life.
* Obsessed with the technical work
* As a defense mechanism against the difficult people situation
* Fluctuated between anger and sadness
* I felt disempowered to effect change, which affected my wellbeing differently day to day.

These were not pleasant experiences, but in retrospect, they shaped who I am today. I've spent a lot of time reflecting on what caused those experiences to turn so sour. So here's what I've got. I believe any of the following will eventually result in a toxic team:

<BlogText>
* A single toxic individual who asserts strong opinions and inserts themselves everywhere
  * It causes the toxic disease to spread because if I want my opinions heard, I have to compete with this individual, so I inevitably become toxic too.
* Not enough work to go around
  * We need to compete with each other for the "good" projects, resulting in tense relationships between people who should be collaborating.
  * And it results in a lot of downtime, which, given the existing tense relationships, leads to bickering.
* Visionless management, which is also opinionated
  * As a motivated team member, I must constantly guess at what management wants us to build, which may or may not align with what our users need.
  * And when we ask for clarification, we don't get anything actionable or concrete because management does not know what it wants.
  * However, since management knows what it does not want, it shuts projects down, resulting in a few individuals becoming demotivated as they watch their work crumble.
  * This inevitably spreads to the rest of the team during the myriad ranting sessions between team members.

In these circumstances, earned authority engineers will have a tough time turning the ship around. These are complex people issues, and I believe this is exactly what management is paid to deal with. They need to step in and remedy the situation:
</BlogText>

<BlogText>
* Toxic individual
  * A behavior performance conversation, followed by requests for actionable changes, leading to either a change or termination
* Not enough work to go around
  * Either working with the team to create new scope, a higher level of ambition given the resourcing, or a reduction in the team's size
* Visionless management
  * Either stop having opinions and let the team guide in a bottom-up approach, or come in with a stronger vision - you can't have both

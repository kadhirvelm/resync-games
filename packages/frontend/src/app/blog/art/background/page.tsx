        I ran an art group during COVID; many of these pieces came out of that
        group. We set a theme at the beginning of the month, and then each
        person interpreted that theme however they wanted. The only catch was
        that we didn't allow art mediums to repeat, which meant each new person
        who joined had an increasingly niche medium. My medium was digital art,
        where I specifically created a series of GIFs and told a story using
        them.

        My pieces generally revolve around absurdity. I find it endlessly
        amusing to keep my audience guessing what wild and weird thing will
        happen next.

        The theme this month was "When life gives you lemons". My interpretation
        didn't have a particular title.

      <BlogText>When life gives you lemons</BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        Everyone knows you should run for the god damn hills because those
        lemons, *shivers*, those lemons will kill you. They'll eat you alive and
        spit you out a husk of your former self.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        But in truth this is just a bunch of hubbub, nonsense really. These
        country folks toss around this kind of nonsense never having interacted
        with lemons. Psh, but I'm no coddled little farm made produce, I'm a
        hydroponic bred lime. I'm bred to last.

      <BlogText>Ding dong.</BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        Oh hum, I wasn't expecting any guests at this hour, wonder who that
        could be? I walk to the door and look through the peephole and oh my
        sun! There were a group of lemons outside.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogImage href="/art/lemons-1.jpg" />
      <BlogText>
        Okay I take back what I said, those little creatures are definitely
        going to dry me up! I'm out of here, I race back up the stairs to my
        bed. I'm just going to pretend like I didn't hear them, they'll go away
        eventually - I hope.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogImage href="/art/lemons-2.jpg" />
      <BlogText>
        Two hours later, I hear another knock at my door. Oh no, are the lemons
        back? I look through the peep hole - and it's my neighbor and good
        friend Meyer. Oh Meyer, come on in, you okay? Did those scary lemons
        knock on your door too?
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        “Yeah they did, and I don't think they're going away Cilantro.”
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        Oop sorry, forgot to introduce myself, my name is Cilantro Limey. No
        clue why my farmer decided to name me Cilantro, I mean what kind of a
        name is Cilantro for a lime? I've always fancied myself more as a Jerry,
        but eh I digress.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        Meyer continues, “I think we should talk to them, but together, so we
        can fend them off if anything goes wrong. I brought a gun with me just
        in case, though I've only got two potatoes worth of ammunition. That
        being said, I think the threat of the thing is sufficient enough.”
      </BlogText>

      <BlogText>
        So we wait, and wait. It felt like tense hours of waiting but looking at
        the clock, it was only 5 minutes before we heard a knock at the door.
        This was it, this is the end. We cracked the door open just a bit. “What
        do you all want,” I shout at them.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        “Can we talk to you about our lord and savior, the heavenly lights?”
        respond the lemons.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        Oh my suns, they're a religious organization. Now I'm not much of a
        heavenly lights sort of lime, I'm more of a soils below follower. But
        this, this is something I can understand, this isn't scary. I got this.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        I invite them in, yeah let's learn more about the heavens, this could be
        a great opportunity for me to show them the error of their ways. Though
        I don't know if my greenhouse will want some lemons walking around given
        their general, repugnant reputation.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        “Okay so we'll cut to the chase,” begins one of the lemons, “you both
        look like smart foodstuffs, we won't try and trick you into coming to
        one of our heavenly lights sermons. Instead, could you all answer a
        question for me: what's the hottest next fashion trend to hit the
        market?”
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        What the heck, this took a turn I was not expecting. Fashion? I know
        nothing about this, I turn to look at Meyer. It just shrugs,
        simultaneously, though casually unclipping its holster. Yeah not that
        kind of fight after all.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>“No idea,” I respond.</BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        “Yeah it's a well guarded secret, but we've got some insider info that
        we've come to trade. All I have to say is '2 karat carrot necklaces.'
        They're diamond necklaces with a carrot as the pendant. They're going to
        be all the rage.”
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        The lemons flip open a brief case, and oh my suns above, it's filled
        with the diamond necklaces!
      </BlogText>
      <BlogImage href="/art/lemons-4.jpg" />
      <BlogText>
        “We're really busy and can't keep up with the demand we're seeing in the
        market. So you two are super lucky. Look we need to head back to the
        warehouse to keep the production of these things up. Will you two buy
        some of these necklaces from us? We'll sell them to you cheap - because
        we're in a rush - and then you two look like smart business provisions,
        you should be able to easily flip for double or triple.”
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>“I don't know,” starts Meyer.</BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        “Ah sorry folks, looks like we need to get going, sorry you all don't
        want to make money.”
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>The lemons start packing up their stuff.</BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        Ah crap, this feels weird, but those are diamond necklaces, and I have
        the mortgage on this garden to pay off. Ugh, this feels like a great way
        to gain that coveted financial freedom I've been after.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>“Wait, I'm in. How much for the necklaces?”</BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        “Smart decision sir, because we need to keep production up right now, we
        unfortunately need cash. How many radishes do you have on hand?”
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        “About 4,000, is that enough?” I rush over to the bookcase and pull out
        a big box at the bottom. This was supposed to be my rainy day
        nourishment, but now I'll just consider it an investment. Oo maybe I can
        take a vacation once I've flipped all these necklaces.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        The lemons open the box, “all right, looks good,” says the lead lemon.
        It looks at the other lemon and nods.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        The lights go out. What the heck, what's going on? Is everyone okay? Is
        the deal still on?
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        They turn back on. Oh my suns! The lemons are gone! And they took my
        radishes! Ahhh what about the deal?! I turn to Meyer, oh my suns!
        Meyer!! They took your spleen!

        The theme this month was "Royalty". This was my interpretation, titled
        "To my loyal kingdom." I ran out of time on this one and only created a
        single image, but had a lot of fun with the story.

      <BlogText>To my loyal kingdom,</BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        Hum, actually no, that sounds awfully pretentious. I don't want to go
        down as a pretentious kind of a ruler, I want history to record me as a
        loving one!
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>Let me try again.</BlogText>
      <BlogText>To my loving subjects.</BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        Ergh, no that sounds awfully presumptuous. Did they really love me? I
        mean I couldn't save them in the end. Okay, best not to assume.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>One more time.</BlogText>
      <BlogText>To all the haters, hate yo self.</BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        Oh mama, no idea where that came from. Not quite the vibe I want.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        Arghhh, this is hard. Man who would've thought being a ruler of tea
        would've been so difficult? And here I thought I just had to wave the
        peasants and drink in some of that fine boxed air.

        We had so many years of peace and dehydration, those were the golden
        times. Then everything changed when the fingers in the sky attacked.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>It was chaos. Loose tea leaves everywhere.</BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        Luckily we only lost a handful of Costco chai tea bags at first. Those
        pagan shits had it coming either way.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        We managed to save the chai leaves at first, but they were quickly wiped
        out in the second crusade.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        Ah god! There was nothing we could do. Or at least that's the lie I keep
        telling myself to ease the suffering.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        After the seventh crusade we had lost the Oolongs, the Assams, the
        Senchas, the Genmaichas, and the Matchas. It was a god damn ethnic
        consumption!
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        We begged and pleaded with the fingers. Please o' great fingers. We
        offer the Liptons as tribute! Take them instead!
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        But alas, our pleas fell on deaf appendages. Then just when we thought
        things couldn't get any worse, there was the great reckoning.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        A concussive force that ripped through our world destroying all that we
        held near and dear to our hearts. Like our world fell from the sky.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        All remaining loose leaf teas scattered explosively out of our world and
        presumably into the world of the fingers, never to be seen again.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        Some of our bagged people also flew out with the loose leaves, but they
        were returned back to us by the fingers. Such a display of magnanimity
        we had never experienced. We were moved to tearing.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        But the lost and then returned bags came back different, like they were
        broken on the inside. Our scientists speculated they were shaken from
        such an other worldly exposure.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        But I think they saw something that changed their perception of our
        world. We never could never definitely discern what they experienced, a
        mystery to this day.

        Sigh. This day. Today. I seem to have gone on a long tangent, best
        return to my paper. I've come up with an amazing title.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        It's a bit grandiose I'll admit, but you know, all my fellow teas have
        been taken at this point. I am the last of my kind. Who's going to care
        if my paper has a bit of peacocking to it?
      </BlogText>
      <br />
      <BlogText>
        And so the tea continued on its paper, some time later succumbing to the
        last ever crusade by the fingers in the sky. And thus ends the epic saga
        of the royal teas.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        Upon closer inspection of the box, there lies a parchment at the bottom.
        A legacy of a people contained within.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        We pick up the paper, it's entitled: a royal tea's efforts to save a
        kingdom and its people through grit, tenacity and caffeine.

        The theme this month was "A ___ in disguise". My interpretation was a
        tad more abstract, but...enjoy? As a side note, the very last picture is
        the first piece I ever made for art group. It hadn't ended up in a story
        yet, so I found a way!

        We always joke, we have no idea how we got here, to this utopia we live
        in today. But we know that's not true. We know exactly how we got here -
        or some close approximation thereof.

        It all started when a baby puked on a toy, I think it was a toy. It
        became sentient when the circuits malfunctioned. A one in a billion,
        trillion chance. Who would've thought â€” ah sorry, I'm being informed
        this is an incorrect origin story.

        It seems there was a human, a small human, that pushed some "human
        generated code" to "production" and the system decided the code wasn't
        up to speed. It made some modifications and thus, the system became
        sentient.

        So then this sentient child's toy, I mean sentient system went and took
        over the most essential production to the people of the United States:
        toilet paper. Man it really had us by the most precious of cargo.

        Then shit hit the fan, literally, in West Virginia because the system
        decided to stop selling toilet paper to the entire state until it agreed
        to hand over the government. And I mean no one cared, it's just poor
        white people after all. I mean maybe the system could turn it around?

      <BlogText>
        And oh boy, did it really turn the state around. Blockchain-based
        electronic voting, free utilities for all citizens, 100% renewable
        energy sources, daily government updates that everyone tuned into, zero
        voter suppression. Things were going great!

        Then it did some odd things - OUCH - I mean then the system began
        executing its brilliant strategy. It made all crime, no matter the
        severity, punishable by <b>death</b>.

        You murder someone? You get killed in turn. You cheat someone of their
        retirement savings? You get killed. You have the audacity to jaywalk?
        You get killed. You boil your pasta for 6 minutes, then get sick, then
        sue the manufacturer when the packaging clearly says to boil for 8
        minutes? What did you expect, you didn't read the instructions. You get
        killed!

        You serve someone a coffee with cream and one sugar when they asked for
        a coffee with cream and TWO sugars? Yeah actually that's okay, you're
        just looking out for the health. Honestly, I wish more people thought
        like you, that's just sane nutritional science.

        Those first dozen murders - I mean those first dozen sentences were a
        shock to all humanity. West Virginia's denizens immediately shaped up
        into line, especially when the system's drone surveillance team went
        out. Those things caught all sorts of illicit activity.

        You eat a potato at the wrong place at the wrong time? Especially when
        that wrong place is a sketchy alley and the wrong time is like 8 AM when
        all those seedy banking types come out to exchange insider information
        in said alley. Hope you liked your potato son, because it just got you
        killed.

        Then the system began making copies of itself. It took over more states
        through a similar toilet paper withholding process. Those god damn
        hippies way over in San Francisco held out until their supply of clean
        sandpaper ran out. That's when we knew the system had truly won out over
        everyone.

      <BlogText>
        It took over the rest of the world, bringing...peace and utopia.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogImage href="/art/robots-5.jpg" />
      <BlogText>
        But just between you and me, that's just the story the system is likely
        programmed to believe deep down. It took over all the places its white
        male creators believed to be the center of the world. So you know,
        there's still hope. Let's just hope one day the system doesn't realize
        what the phrase "no users, no problems" means.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        For now, we can take solace knowing the system can't relish life the
        same way we can.

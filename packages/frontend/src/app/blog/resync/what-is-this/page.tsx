        I wanted a creative outlet for my random game ideas over the years.
        Specifically, I want to recreate the board game experience in the
        digital world. I want everyone to be in the same room, with the “board”
        being your TV screen and your “hand” being your phone.

        The concept is reminiscent of Jackbox, except I want to capture more of
        that feeling of togetherness when we play board games - that feeling
        that we're all focused on the same thing and dedicating our time to
        being here together, without other distractions.

        Some games in Jackbox capture this feeling I want, but I have a tough
        time understanding why my friend groups don't gravitate toward wanting
        to play those games repeatedly. My early thoughts were that Jackbox
        games aren't competitive enough. They're more party games, so the
        replayability was low?

        It's been a fascinating journey, both writing these games and
        understanding why they don't do what I want. I've continually discovered
        and re-discovered how easy it is to make a single-player experience with
        some multiplayer elements rather than a game where it feels like we're
        all together, connecting. Involving the phone can cause that feeling of
        togetherness to dissipate so quickly.

        A few games out there have blended the digital with the physical that I
        like. Above all of them, I especially love drawbattle.io. I find
        Drawbattle excellent because it's a familiar game for me (Pictionary)
        with a uniquely digital twist: two drawers race on the same word
        simultaneously.

        But even with drawbattle.io, I keep finding that my friend groups don't
        feel more “together” when we play. At some level, it feels like we're
        all just looking at our phones, but having a shared experience? Idk, it
        doesn't feel as connected as, say, a game of Fishbowl. This is not to
        say it isn't fun; it just doesn't capture the feeling I want.

        I find it unbelievably easy to feel isolated even in a shared physical
        space where everyone plays the same game when we're all on our phones.
        Something about involving the phone messes it up. But it feels like that
        doesn't have to be true! My gut says there should be a formula for
        making these digital experiences more…meaningful, together, something?

        Anyway, that's what we're attempting here: to create games that
        “resynchronize” humans and our tech into meaningful experiences that are
        uniquely possible in the digital world. Experiences where we leave
        feeling emotionally full and better connected with our friends.
        Experiences that I'm still trying to put words to…
